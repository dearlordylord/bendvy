/**
 * Keyed append-only message logs read per reader, like change detection.
 *
 * Each batch is stamped with the change tick at which it was published. A
 * reader asks for the batches stamped after its previous completed run, so
 * every reader sees every message once, in publish order, without a schedule
 * marker.
 *
 * Retention: a batch is kept for at least the current and previous frame, and
 * beyond that until every registered reader of its key has read past it. So a
 * system in a schedule ticked less often than others (a fixed update driven
 * at a lower rate than rendering) still receives everything. A reader that
 * stops running would keep batches alive forever, so each key also has a
 * capacity; past it the oldest batches are dropped and the readers that had
 * not seen them report `lagged`.
