/**
 * Run conditions computed by code: `check(...)`.
 *
 * `Machine.inState` and friends gate systems on state machines. A check gates
 * them on anything the world holds, with ordinary code instead of a growing
 * set of combinators:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const playing = Game.Condition.check("playing", {
 *   resources: { stop: Game.System.readResource(HitStop) },
 *   machines: { flow: Game.System.machine(Flow) }
 * }, ({ resources, machines }) => machines.flow.get() === "Playing" && resources.stop.get().remaining <= 0)
 *
 * Game.Schedule.when([playing], Move, Attack)
 * ```
 *
 * A check declares its reads like a system, and they become requirements of
 * whatever it gates, so a runtime without them is a compile error. Its access
 * is stricter than an inspector's: only resources, machines, and read-only
 * queries without change filters. Every read that consumes or advances a
 * per-reader cursor (events, transition events, `added`/`changed` filters,
 * removed/despawned records, relation failures) is rejected, and so are
 * services. A check gating many systems is evaluated once per system, and
 * with these reads it gives the same answer each time until something it
 * reads is written.
 *
 * Checks are evaluated just before each gated system runs, against committed
 * values: unlike machine conditions, whose values change only at
 * `applyStateTransitions` markers, a write by an earlier system in the same
 * run is visible. A predicate that throws is a defect: the exception
 * propagates like one thrown by a system.
 *
